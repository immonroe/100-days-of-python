# name = input("What is your name?")
# print(name)

# # Both names will be printed rather than one variable overriding the other

# name = "Jack"
# print(name)

# name = "Angela"
# print(name)

# original answer to finding length of name - print(len("What is your name?"))
# Alternate version of finding name length using variables

name = input("What is your name? ")
length = len(name)
print(length)

# Try to set variable names that are easy to read rather than a single letter\
